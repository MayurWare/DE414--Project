                <li>India is the second most populous country in the world, with more than 1 billion citizens. The scale
                    of need
                    in India is immense, making India the concentrated center of the global water and sanitation crisis.
                    About
                    26% of India’s population practices open defecation, a critical factor contributing to water-borne
                    illness,
                    stunting, and death.</li>

                <li>Chemical contamination of water, mainly through fluoride and arsenic, is present in 1.96 million
                    dwellings.
                    Excess fluoride in India may be affecting tens of millions of people across 19 states, while equally
                    worryingly, excess arsenic may affect up to 15 million people in India, according to the World
                    Health
                    Organization (WHO).</li>

                <li>Data collected from the Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation states that 45,053 villages had
                    access to
                    piped water and handpumps by the end of 2016-17, accounting for 64.19 per cent of India. Almost
                    19,000
                    villages across the country still do not receive regular water supply.</li>

                            on the ground, eliminating the physical strain of carrying water containers.
                            The water wheel makes it easy to fetch water from the nearest drinking water source.

                            has the capacity to carry 50 litres.

                            traditional containers. It is fitted with a plastic or metal handle, which allows the user
                            to roll it down the road, without having to lift the weight.

                        <li>Provision of clean drinking water supply in rural India continues to be an enormous
                            challenge. Elderly in the rural parts of India have very less access to clean and filtered
                            drinking water. Due to the consumption of contaminated water, they acquire waterborne
                            diseases and a plethora of other illnesses.
                            So with an aim to make clean drinking water accessible to them filters using natural
                            substances for filtration come to the rescue.
                        </li>
                        <li>Nano clay particles form the crux of the Terafil candle. The pores in the candles are
                            smaller than the Nano-sized microbes like bacteria and virus, thus enabling the candles to
                            filter the pathogens in the top layer itself, thus enabling the clean, good water to
                            percolate and pass through it and get dropped in the bottom container. The capillary holes
                            formed within the candle structure are so complex that it does not allow turbid materials,
                            other waste solids, minerals and metal complexes to flow outside its structure.</li>
                        <li>Therefore, the murky water which also has iron particles and pathogens gets filtered and
                            clean water flows down due to gravitational pull and gets collected in the bottom container.

                        right?

                    <p><strong>Answer :</strong> Water is a necessary resource, hence we have to do it.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Question :</strong> Yes that is true and what about filtration?</p>
                    <p><strong>Answer :</strong> We have a water filter , so that's not a problem.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Question :</strong> So tell me about the problem faced during the fetching of water from
                        the

                    <p><strong>Answer : </strong> <i>Problem toh wahi carry karne me hota hai.</i> (Carrying the water
                        is
                        the problem)</p>
                </li>
                <li>

                    <p><strong>Answer : </strong> Women mostly use <i>garia</i> and oil container and men use

                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Question :</strong> Oh Okay! Do you experience pain in your body due to this?</p>
                    <p><strong>Answer : </strong> Mera to shoulder pain hota hai (I experience shoulder pain) due to the
                        load of
                        that device and in my legs also.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Question :</strong> Can’t you connect the pipe system from the river ?</p>
                    <p><strong>Answer : </strong> It's not possible for one household to be established. River is too
                        far for
                        this. But very few households have their own well they have a pipe system.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Question :</strong> For the household having well, they don't need to fetch from the
                        river, right?</p>
                    <p><strong>Answer : </strong> Yes, you are right. But in summer they have to collect water from the
                        river
                        due to the drying of wells.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Question :</strong> Tell me about the people who collect water? Which age group do they
                        belong
                        to?</p>
                    <p><strong>Answer : </strong> Yes, mostly they are around the age 30-60 years including women.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Question :</strong> So, we are trying to develop a solution for people like you who face
                        stress
                        in their body parts due to these reasons. Of course we will help people like you if we succeed.
